title: Introducing Poole
---

*The first post* seems to start with a subheading.

Just forked the most simple template I could find, to understand how this will work. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator running at GitHub will take it and render a website from it. It apparently comes with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.

Next step would be to look at the two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)


### What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/atom.xml), posts, and [example page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about))

### Download

Poole is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
